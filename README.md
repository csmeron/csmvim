# CSMvim
This repo is the host/storage for my personal Neovim config.

This config was heavily inspired by both [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim) and [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad), which I used
prior to fully learning Lua and Vim/Neovim as a whole. 

Therefore, much credit goes to those two projects for inspiration.

## Features
- Lazy loaded via [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)
- Easy and fast theme swapping with [themery.nvim](https://github.com/themery.nvim)
- Easily extendable LSP configuration thanks to [mason.nvim](https://github.com/mason-org/mason)
- And various others.
- More to be added. Currently in a simply functional state

## Prerequisites
- Ensure Neovim is at least v0.10.0
- Have wget, curl, unzip, pip, npm, node, luarocks, ripgrep, cargo, etc. installed.
- Have a nerd font installed.
